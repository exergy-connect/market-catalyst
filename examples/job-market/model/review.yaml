    brief: "Yelp-style structured review of hiring experience"
    description: |
      Structured, verifiable reviews of hiring experiences. These are not free-text
      reviews but structured data points that can be cross-verified. Based on
      three dimensions: Transparency (were promises kept?), Experiential Respect
      (was humanity honored?), and Time Efficiency (was effort proportional to outcome?).
      These reviews feed into all interface views: Trust Stock Market, Google Maps,
      Wikipedia, and Simple Signals.
