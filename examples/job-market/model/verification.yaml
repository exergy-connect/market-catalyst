      Cross-verification data, manipulation detection, and evidence weighting
      for reviews. This implements the Verification & Anti-Gamification Layer
      that ensures data reliability. Includes cross-referencing for consistency,
      weighting by verifiability, and detection of coordinated manipulation.
