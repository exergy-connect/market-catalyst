# 🌀 Market-Catalyst (Core)

> **"Converting Market Entropy into Human Exergy."**

**Market-Catalyst** is an open-source, GitHub-native kernel for building auditable marketplaces. It provides the foundational logic for a new paradigm of exchange—one where **integrity is the primary currency** and **transparency is enforced by the architecture, not the participants.**

## 🔬 The Concept

Traditional marketplaces are designed to maximize volume, which inevitably leads to high noise, information asymmetry, and the "Efficiency Paradox."

The **Market-Catalyst** fixes this by treating every market interaction as a verifiable "Audit." By mapping the **Promises** made by an originator against the **Actual Outcomes** recorded on a public ledger, the Catalyst calculates the "Market Gravity" of any opportunity.

## 🏗️ The Architecture

This repository provides the **Generic Kernel**. It is industry-agnostic and built to be "Sovereign-First."

### 1. The Immutable Ledger (Git-as-a-Backend)

We do not use traditional databases. All market data is stored in **JSON-schema compliant files** within the repository.

* **Tamper-Proof:** Every change is logged via Git version control.
* **Publicly Auditable:** Anyone can "fork" the truth or "blame" a record to see its history.
* **Zero Friction:** No hosting costs or database maintenance for entrepreneurs.

### 2. Vouch-Based Integrity

Trust is anchored in **GitHub Identities**.

* Instead of anonymous likes, we use **Vouches**.
* A Vouch is a structural link between a GitHub UID and a market claim.
* Reputation is weighted by the "Exergy" (historical proof-of-work) of the voucher's GitHub profile.

### 3. The Core Schema

The kernel operates on four universal entities:

* **Originator:** The entity making a claim (e.g., Employer, Landlord).
* **Opportunity:** The unit of exchange (e.g., Job Posting, Rental).
* **Protocol:** The timeline of events that verify the interaction.
* **Attestation (The Vouch):** The external validation of the claim.

## 🚀 The Franchise Model

This repo is designed to be **cloned**. An entrepreneur can take this "Unbaked" kernel and deploy a specialized instance (e.g., for local hiring, ethical housing, or freelance services) in minutes.

**Example Implementation:** See `/examples/labor-market` for a reference implementation of Sarah Springsteen Trumble’s *Theory of Online Market Gravity*.
